# nvim-own
Based on [Kickstart](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). Making the configuration my own.
The main purpose of this repository is to keep track of my own modifications to the configuration.
You should definitely checkout the Kickstart repo and read that configuration through before
checking this one.

```text
git clone https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
